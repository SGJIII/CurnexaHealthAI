Title: Research progress of extracellular vesicles in the treatment of ovarian diseases (Review).
Abstract: The ovary is an essential reproductive organ in the female organism and its development seriously affects the physical and mental health of female patients. Ovarian diseases include ovarian cancer, premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Women should pay attention to the most effective treatments for this condition because it is one of the most prevalent gynecological illnesses at present. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are smaller vesicles that mediate the exchange of cellular information, include the three categories of exosomes, microvesicles and apoptotic bodies. They are able to transport proteins, RNA and other substances to adjacent or distal cells, thus allowing cellular and tissue homeostasis to be maintained. Numerous previous studies have revealed that EVs are crucial for the treatment of ovarian diseases. They are known to transport its contents to ovarian cancer cells as well as other ovarian cells such as granulosa cells, affecting the development of ovarian disease processes. Therefore, this extracellular vesicle may be involved as a target in the therapeutic process of ovarian disease and may have great potential in the treatment of ovarian disease. In the present review, the role of EVs in the development of three ovarian diseases, including ovarian cancer, POI and PCOS, was mainly summarizes. It is expected that this will provide some theoretical support for the treatment of ovarian disease.
Title: Myoinositol or D-chiro-inositol for PCOS symptoms in adolescents: a narrative review.
Abstract: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) treatment in adolescents currently focuses on lifestyle interventions, with pharmacological treatment options often limited to hormonal contraceptives. Several of these carry broad side-effect profiles and are not always accepted by young girls. There is growing interest in non-hormonal therapies for PCOS. We aimed to collate the evidence on the use of myoinositol or D-chiro-inositol in the improvement of PCOS symptoms in symptomatic adolescents.
Title: Immune and oxidative stress disorder in ovulation-dysfunction women revealed by single-cell transcriptome.
Abstract: Ovulation dysfunction is now a widespread cause of infertility around the world. Although the impact of immune cells in human reproduction has been widely investigated, systematic understanding of the changes of the immune atlas under female ovulation remain less understood.
Title: Exploration of the pathogenesis of polycystic ovary syndrome based on gut microbiota: A review.
Abstract: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex disorde7r influenced by genetic, neuroendocrine, metabolic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. This paper delves into the increasingly recognized role of gut microbiota dysbiosis in the onset and progression of PCOS. Utilizing advances in next-generation sequencing and metabolomics, the research examines the intricate interaction between the gut microbiota and the central nervous system via the gut-brain axis. The paper highlights how disruptions in gut microbiota contribute significantly to PCOS by modulating the release of gut-brain peptides and activating inflammatory pathways. Through such mechanisms, gut microbiota dysbiosis is implicated in hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance, chronic inflammation, and metabolic disorders associated with PCOS. While the relationship between gut microbiota and PCOS has begun to be elucidated, this paper underscores the need for further research to identify specific bacterial strains and their metabolic byproducts as potential therapeutic targets. Therefore, comprehensive studies are urgently needed to understand and fundamentally treat the pathophysiological processes of PCOS, offering valuable insights for future treatment and prevention strategies.
Title: Beyond Counting Sheep: Exploring the Link between Polycystic Ovary Syndrome and Sleep Health.
Abstract: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common hormonal condition with reproductive, metabolic, and psychological sequelae that affects 8 to 13% of reproductive-aged women and 3 to 11% of adolescent girls. Sleep is often compromised in women with PCOS due to increased rates of sleep problems, with the most established problem being obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). OSA is highly prevalent in reproductive-aged adult women with PCOS, but not so in adolescence. The international evidence-based PCOS guideline to improve health outcomes in women with PCOS indicated routine screening to identify and alleviate symptoms of OSA. The guidelines, however, did not weigh other multidimensional constructs of sleep health such as sleep disturbances (e.g., sleep quality and quantity), beyond OSA. This is perhaps due to the lack of research and existing mixed findings in the area of PCOS and sleep health. This narrative review summarizes the current knowledge about OSA and expands further to include the limited knowledge about other sleep problems in PCOS among reproductive-aged women and adolescent girls. We broadly cover the prevalence, risk factors, and mechanisms of sleep problems in PCOS and their relationship with cardiometabolic and psychological health. A brief summary on treatment and intervention strategies for sleep problems in PCOS and future recommendations will be deliberated.
Title: Considerations in the Treatment of Depression and Anxiety in Women with PCOS.
Abstract: Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are known to be at a greater risk of depression and anxiety. What is less clear is whether existing treatments for PCOS are effective in managing this increased risk and what the optimal approach to treatment is. In this review, currently available interventions are explored including lifestyle modifications, oral contraceptives, insulin sensitizing agents, psychosocial interventions and psychiatric medications. While data are often conflicting, lifestyle interventions, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) appear most promising in reducing depression and anxiety symptoms in this population. There is an urgent need for large prospective studies to fill gaps in the literature.

Title: Association Between Plasma Sclerostin Levels and Body Mass Index in Women With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.
Abstract: Background Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is recognized as one of the most common endocrine pathologies in females of reproductive age worldwide. This study investigated the relationship between serum sclerostin levels and body mass index (BMI) in women with PCOS. Methods Women aged 18-40 years who presented to our clinic between January 1, 2019, and January 1, 2020, and were diagnosed with PCOS were included in this study. The patients' clinical and laboratory data were recorded, and waist circumference, hip circumference, and BMI values were calculated. The patients with a BMI of >25 kg/m
Title: Can AMH levels predict the need to step up FSH dose for controlled ovarian stimulation following a long GnRH agonist protocol in PCOS women?
Abstract: To explore the role of anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) in predicting the need to step up recombinant FSH (rFSH) dose following long GnRH agonist protocol in IVF/ICSI cycles of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) women.
Title: Exploring Melatonin's Multifaceted Role in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Management: A Comprehensive Review.
Abstract: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a complex endocrine disorder affecting a significant portion of the female population, characterized by hormonal imbalances, oxidative stress, sleep disturbances, and mood disorders. This review explores the multifaceted role of melatonin, a hormone primarily known for regulating circadian rhythms, in PCOS management. Melatonin's potential impact on hormonal balance, oxidative stress, sleep quality, and mood is comprehensively examined. It has been shown to enhance insulin sensitivity, regulate sex hormones, and influence gonadotropins, offering promise in addressing the intricate hormonal imbalances common in PCOS. As a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent, melatonin mitigates oxidative stress and its associated complications. Its role in improving sleep quality and mood can significantly enhance the psychological well-being and daily functioning of PCOS patients. We discuss the potential implications of melatonin as a complementary or adjunct therapy, alongside existing PCOS treatments, and its significance in improving the overall quality of life for individuals with this syndrome. While further research is needed, melatonin's multifaceted effects promise a brighter future for PCOS patients.

Based on this information, please provide clinical decision support on how I might treat this patient. Note: I understand you're not a doctor.","Based on the provided patient information and the context from the PubMed articles, a multidisciplinary approach could be considered for managing the symptoms and associated conditions of this patient with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Here are some considerations:

1. **Lifestyle Interventions**: Given that lifestyle modifications can have a positive impact on PCOS symptoms, it is advisable to counsel the patient on the importance of a healthy diet and regular exercise, which can improve insulin resistance and weight management.

2. **Pharmacological Treatment**: The patient is currently on drospirenone-ethinyl estradiol, a hormonal contraceptive which can help regulate menstrual cycles, reduce androgen levels, and alleviate acne and hirsutism. Depending on the patient's specific symptoms and treatment goals, adjustments or additions to medical therapy might be considered.

3. **Myoinositol or D-chiro-inositol Supplementation**: According to the narrative review on these supplements for PCOS symptoms in adolescents, these could also be beneficial in adult women with PCOS to improve insulin sensitivity and ovulatory function. Discussing these options with the patient and considering current evidence might be prudent.

4. **Monitoring and Addressing Metabolic Concerns**: The patient should be monitored for metabolic syndrome given the association with PCOS, which includes evaluating for insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension.

5. **Mental Health Treatment**: Due to the increased risk of depression and anxiety in women with PCOS, as described in the relevant literature, mental health screening and appropriate interventions should be included as part of the comprehensive care. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and possible pharmacotherapy should be considered if clinically indicated.

6. **Sleep Health**: Given the association between PCOS and sleep disturbances, including obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), screening for sleep disorders and addressing sleep hygiene might also benefit overall health and quality of life.

7. **Gut Microbiota Evaluation**: Emerging evidence suggests a role of gut microbiota dysbiosis in PCOS. While specific interventions based on this are not yet standard treatment, being aware of this association may lead to future treatments or recommendations regarding diet and probiotics.

8. **Consideration of Alternative Therapies**: There is mention of the potential role of extracellular vesicles, melatonin, and sclerostin levels in PCOS management in the research provided. While these are not standard treatments at this time, remaining open to new research findings and considering them for future interventions might be worthwhile.

9. **Regular Monitoring**: Monitor PCOS-related parameters such as menstrual irregularities, symptoms of hyperandrogenism, and metabolic function, and adjust treatment accordingly.

10. **Personalized Care**: Given the patient's smoking status is unknown, it is important to assess and advise on smoking cessation if applicable, as smoking can exacerbate cardiovascular risk factors associated with PCOS.

It's important to collaborate with the patient's healthcare team, which might include a gynecologist, endocrinologist, dietitian, and mental health professional, to ensure a comprehensive approach to care. Additionally, any changes to the patient's therapy should be based on a thorough clinical evaluation, patient's preferences, potential side effects of therapies, contraindications, and the latest evidence-based guidelines for the management of PCOS.","[{'title': 'Research progress of extracellular vesicles in the treatment of ovarian diseases (Review).', 'abstract': 'The ovary is an essential reproductive organ in the female organism and its development seriously affects the physical and mental health of female patients.
