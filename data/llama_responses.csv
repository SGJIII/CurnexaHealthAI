Here are some articles and abstracts for additional context to help with your recommendation:

Title: Pericardial Effusion with Tamponade in Untreated Hypothyroidism.
Abstract: BACKGROUND Small pericardial effusions are common with chronic hypothyroidism, but large pericardial effusion with tamponade or pre-tamponade physiology is a rare complication of severe uncontrolled hypothyroidism. Presentation of pericardial effusion of any etiology can range from being asymptomatic to hemodynamic instability with cardiac tamponade, depending on the amount and speed of accumulation of pericardial fluid, but pericardial effusion associated with hypothyroidism are usually small. Protracted medication non-adherence was a key factor in our patient's presentation. CASE REPORT We present a case of a woman in her 40s with a known history of autoimmune hypothyroidism with medication non-adherence for longer than 9 months who presented with fatigue, weight gain, limited physical activity, and exertional dyspnea with bilateral swelling of the upper and lower extremities. Examination revealed muffled heart sounds, positive JVD, and positive pulsus paradoxus. She had an elevated TSH, low free T4, and a high anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody level. Echocardiography revealed a large pericardial effusion with impending tamponade. Pericardiocentesis with pericardial drain was done and the patient's symptoms resolved quickly. The patient was restarted on a prior dose of levothyroxine 175 mcg. She had improved by the 3rd day of hospitalization; the pericardial drain was removed, and she was discharged with access to medication. Follow-up revealed complete resolution of her symptoms. CONCLUSIONS This case emphasizes the importance of recognition of hypothyroidism as the etiology of life-threatening large pericardial effusions, as it is treatable and recurrences are preventable. To prevent recurrence, it is important to achieve euthyroidism after treating an episode of pericardial effusion.

Title: Hypothyroidism and Pericardial Effusion: A Case Report and Literature Review.
Abstract: BACKGROUND Hypothyroidism is a common endocrine disorder that can have various manifestations, including cardiovascular complications. Pericardial effusion is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of hypothyroidism. CASE REPORT We present a case of a 50-year-old woman with hypothyroidism who presented with fatigue, weight gain, and swelling of the legs. She was found to have a large pericardial effusion and was diagnosed with hypothyroidism. The patient was treated with levothyroxine, and the pericardial effusion resolved completely. A literature review of hypothyroidism and pericardial effusion was also conducted. CONCLUSIONS Hypothyroidism can cause pericardial effusion, a potentially life-threatening complication. Early recognition and treatment of hypothyroidism are essential to prevent such complications.

Title: Pericardial Effusion in Hypothyroidism: A Rare but Potentially Life-Threatening Complication.
Abstract: BACKGROUND Hypothyroidism is a common endocrine disorder that can have various manifestations, including cardiovascular complications. Pericardial effusion is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of hypothyroidism. CASE REPORT We present a case of a 45-year-old woman with hypothyroidism who presented with fatigue, weight gain, and swelling of the legs. She was found to have a large pericardial effusion and was diagnosed with hypothyroidism. The patient was treated with levothyroxine, and the pericardial effusion resolved completely. CONCLUSIONS Hypothyroidism can cause pericardial effusion, a potentially life-threatening complication. Early recognition and treatment of hypothyroidism are essential to prevent such complications.

Based on the provided articles and abstracts, it appears that pericardial effusion is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of hypothyroidism. In the presented cases, the patients experienced fatigue, weight gain, and swelling of the legs, which are common symptoms of hypothyroidism. However, the presence of a large pericardial effusion indicated a more severe complication.

Given the patient's history of hypothyroidism and the presence of a large pericardial effusion, it is likely that the effusion is caused by the hypothyroidism. Therefore, the recommendation would be to treat the patient with levothyroxine to restore euthyroidism and monitor the patient's response.

In addition to levothyroxine therapy, the patient should be monitored for signs of cardiac tamponade, such as muffled heart sounds, jugular venous distension, and pulsus paradoxus. If the patient's symptoms do not improve or worsen despite levothyroxine therapy, pericardiocentesis may be considered to drain the effusion and relieve pressure on the heart.

It is also important to address the patient's medication non-adherence, which may have contributed to the development of the large pericardial effusion. The patient should be counseled on the importance of taking medication as prescribed and adhering to follow-up appointments to prevent such complications in the future.

In summary, the recommendation for a 50-year-old female with fatigue, weight gain, and diagnosed with hypothyroidism, who presents with a large pericardial effusion, would be to treat the patient with levothyroxine to restore euthyroidism, monitor the patient's response, and address medication non-adherence."
