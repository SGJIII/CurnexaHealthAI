Title: Takayasu's arteritis presenting as acute STEMI.
Abstract: An 18-year-old man with past medical history of secondary arterial hypertension diagnosed at age 15 presented with an abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that exhibited left renal artery stenosis.
Title: Association of Neighborhood-Level Marginalization With Health Care Use and Clinical Outcomes Following Hospital Discharge in Patients Who Underwent Coronary Catheterization for Acute Myocardial Infarction in a Single-Payer Health Care System.
Abstract: Canadian data suggest that patients of lower socioeconomic status with acute myocardial infarction receive less beneficial therapy and have worse clinical outcomes, raising questions regarding care disparities even in universal health care systems. We assessed the contemporary association of marginalization with clinical outcomes and health services use.
Title: Percutaneous coronary intervention for chronic total occlusion of the left circumflex branch in mirror dextrocardia: a case report.
Abstract: Mirror dextrocardia (MDC) is a condition in which the heart is located in a mirror-image position on the right side of the chest compared to the normal position in individuals with physiological variations. Patients with MDC and chronic total occlusion (CTO) of the left circumflex branch (LCX) are extremely rare in clinical practice. The treatment of MDC-CTO-LCX differs significantly from patients without mirror dextrocardia and the same condition in terms of instrument selection and procedural techniques. In this article, we report a successful case of interventional treatment in a patient with MDC-CTO-LCX. We summarize the anatomical and electrocardiographic variations in patients with MDC-CTO-LCX, and discuss the selection of interventional instruments and techniques that can be useful for interventionists as well as the diagnostic and therapeutic considerations that can be helpful for clinical physicians.
Title: Patient-level explainable machine learning to predict major adverse cardiovascular events from SPECT MPI and CCTA imaging.
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has shown promise in improving the risk prediction in non-invasive cardiovascular imaging, including SPECT MPI and coronary CT angiography. However, most algorithms used remain black boxes to clinicians in how they compute their predictions. Furthermore, objective consideration of the multitude of available clinical data, along with the visual and quantitative assessments from CCTA and SPECT, are critical for optimal patient risk stratification. We aim to provide an explainable ML approach to predict MACE using clinical, CCTA, and SPECT data.
Title: Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis and Pancreatic Cancer: A Rare Association.
Abstract: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) or hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS) is a life-threatening and relatively rare condition that usually presents as a multisystem febrile illness. It is associated with excessive activation of the immune system and hypercytokinemia, leading to an unregulated aggregation of macrophages and lymphocytes. Here, we present the first likely case of HLH with metastatic pancreatic carcinoma being the underlying etiology.
Title: Frequency of lipoprotein(a) measurements in patients with or at risk of cardiovascular disease.
Abstract: Knowledge of lipoprotein(a) measurement in community practice is limited. The objective of this study is to evaluate the frequency of Lp(a) screening across the University of Rochester Medical Center (URMC). Descriptive data were collected for all URMC patients >= 18 years old who have had at least one Lp(a) measurement from January 2011 to August 2022 from the URMC electronic health record (EHR). Cardiovascular diagnoses were queried to define yearly frequency and demographic information. We identified 2,698 patients with at least one Lp(a) result. An increasing number of patients were tested per year. There were more women than men, and about 11% having more than one Lp(a) measured with the majority having a level <30 mg/dL (the normal-range in the UMRC lab). The majority do not have a listed diagnosis of cerebral infarction, peripheral vascular disease, myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, or aortic stenosis. Across URMC, there has been a steady increase of Lp(a) measurements in the past several years.
Title: Outcomes of patients with atrial fibrillation on oral anticoagulation with and without heart failure: the ETNA-AF-Europe registry.
Abstract: Heart failure (HF) is a risk factor for major adverse events in atrial fibrillation (AF). Whether this risk persists on non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) and varies according to left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is debated.
Title: Higher docosahexaenoic acid levels lower the protective impact of eicosapentaenoic acid on long-term major cardiovascular events.
Abstract: Long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (OM3 PUFA) are commonly used for cardiovascular disease prevention. High-dose eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) is reported to reduce major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE); however, a combined EPA and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supplementation has not been proven to do so. This study aimed to evaluate the potential interaction between EPA and DHA levels on long-term MACE.

Title: Cardiovascular Disease Burden and Major Adverse Cardiac Events in Young Black Patients: A National Analysis of 2 Cohorts 10 Years Apart (2017 Versus 2007).
Abstract: Background We aim to compare the burden of cardiovascular disease risk factors and major adverse cardiac events and in-hospital outcomes among young Black patients (aged 18-44 years) hospitalized in 2007 and 2017 using data obtained from the National Inpatient Sample database. Method and Results Comparison of the sociodemographic characteristics, comorbidities, and inpatient outcomes, including major adverse cardiac events (all-cause mortality, acute myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest, ventricular fibrillation/flutter, pulmonary embolism, and coronary intervention), between 2017 and 2007 was performed. Multivariable analyses were performed, controlling for potential covariates. A total of 2 922 743 (mean age, 31 years; 70.3% women) admissions among young Black individuals were studied (1 341 068 in 2007 and 1 581 675 in 2017). The 2017 cohort had a younger population (mean, 30 versus 31 years; 

Based on this information, please provide clinical decision support on how I might treat this patient. Note: I understand you're not a doctor.","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of a past heart attack and heart disease. The patient's medication is unknown, and there are no details about the current symptoms or specific concerns. However, I can offer some general insights based on the patient's medical history.

1. Past heart attack and heart disease: Given the history of a past heart attack and heart disease, it is crucial to manage the patient's cardiovascular health appropriately. This may involve lifestyle modifications, such as quitting smoking (if the patient smokes), adopting a heart-healthy diet, engaging in regular exercise, and managing other risk factors like hypertension, cholesterol levels, and diabetes if applicable.

2. Medication and allergies: It would be important to determine the specific medications the patient is taking and be aware of any allergies, particularly to nickel and penicillins. This information is crucial for avoiding any potential drug interactions or adverse reactions.

3. Takayasu's arteritis: The mentioned article describes a case of Takayasu's arteritis presenting as acute STEMI. Although specific information about the patient's condition is lacking, it is important to consider this rare vasculitis as part of the differential diagnosis, especially if the patient presents with symptoms suggestive of coronary artery involvement.

4. Socioeconomic status and healthcare disparities: The article discussing healthcare disparities in patients with acute myocardial infarction highlights the potential impact of socioeconomic factors on care and clinical outcomes. Healthcare providers should be mindful of these disparities and strive to provide equitable and optimal care for all patients.

As a virtual assistant, I cannot provide specific treatment recommendations or assess the patient's current condition, as that requires a thorough evaluation by a healthcare professional. It is important for the patient to consult with their healthcare provider, who can consider their complete medical history, perform a physical examination, and order any necessary tests to make an accurate diagnosis and provide appropriate treatment.","[{'title': ""Takayasu's arteritis presenting as acute STEMI."", 'abstract': 'An 18-year-old man with past medical history of secondary arterial hypertension diagnosed at age 15 presented with an abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that exhibited left renal artery stenosis.'}, {'title': 'Association of Neighborhood-Level Marginalization With Health Care Use and Clinical Outcomes Following Hospital Discharge in Patients Who Underwent Coronary Catheterization for Acute Myocardial Infarction in a Single-Payer Health Care System.', 'abstract': 'Canadian data suggest that patients of lower socioeconomic status with acute myocardial infarction receive less beneficial therapy and have worse clinical outcomes, raising questions regarding care disparities even in universal health care systems.
